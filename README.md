Choose Your Own Adventure Games - Game Engine
First version with Spring Data and other stuffs - really overkilled and a bit useless.
This version doesn't aim to be run, it is just an unfinished nice first try, a draft built on the technologies I used in class. 
That explains the lack of documentation.
